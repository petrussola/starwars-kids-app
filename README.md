- Little fun project so my kids can browse characters, spaceships, planets and vehicles from Star Wars movies.
- Built with:

1. Create-react-app
2. SWAPI.dev - Star Wars API. Unforntunately only 6 movies are available for now, so cool that such resource exists nevertheless.
3. Microsoft Bing Image Search API

Backlog:

1. Error handling
2. Add Star Wars props to make it a bit more themed :)
